% Problem 1. Curve fitting. 
% Part 1. Take 10 x values on the interval 0 < x <= 10 and then create y
% values from the x values by plugging the x values into a third order
% polynomial of your choice. Add random noise to the data by choosing a random number
% in the interval [-D, D]. Start with D = 1. Plot your data in the x-y plane.

X = sort(10*rand(1,10));

% The increasing noise in the model makes the lower orders of polynomial
% fits worse than the higher orders (3 and above). The larger the noise is
% ,the worse the fitting curve of the lower orders is. Generally, higher

% numbers chosen from each of these two distributions as a function of N.

% Part 2. Now keep the first distribution the same, but vary the mean of

% set of axes. What is special about the case where the mean of the second

% when the mean of the second distriution is 0, which the same as the first
% distribution, the mean of pval is significantly higher than others.So we
% can only see that curve given how the axis are set. This means we cannot
% reject the null when the second distribution's mean is 0. It also means
% the 2 distributions are the same.

% Part 3. Now keep the means of the two distributions at 0 and 1 as in part
% 1, but vary the variance of both distributions simultaneiously between 0.1 and 10 and plot the 
% p-values vs the number of numbers drawn as before. Comment on your results.

p_val_m2 = [];
for var = 0.1:1:10.1
    for ii = 1:N
        A = normrnd(0,var,[1,N]);
        B = normrnd(1,var,[1,N]);
        [~,p_val_m2((var-0.1)+1,ii)] = ttest2(A,B);

% when the variance is small, the p values are small as well. This is
% because the distribution of the second distribution are all around the
% mean. Hence it has a greater chance to reject the null when the variance
% is very small. As the variance increases, the p-value increases. because
% the higher the variance is, the more chance the number in the second
% distribution will overlap the first one, and the higher possibility that
% we cannot reject the null.
